            Welcome, I am <strong>Ben</strong>. I am a passionate creator - <strong>Composing music</strong>, Coding web applications, and <strong>Crafting solutions</strong> to present problems. I am a patient observer - focusing on the fine aspects of music, embracing nature and the world we live in, and discerning the <strong>intricate details</strong> of life. My love of the water - oceans, lakes, boats, beaches - represents my willingness to explore, both the world around us and different paths to <strong>success</strong>. It also represents my appreciation for the importance of relaxation, in stressful high-pressure situations and in daily life.

           <strong>I have always lived by a quote attributed to Mark Twain,</strong><br><q>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.</q>
